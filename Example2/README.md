A 4-micron-long pn diode

The doping profile is given as a separate file.

The terminal information is given as another separate file.

Assume the constant mobility. For electrons, it is 1417 cm^2/V sec. For holes, it is 470.4 cm^2/V sec.

When the width is 2 micron, the terminal current is 3.76e-3 A at the anode voltage of 1 V.

On the other hand, at the cathode voltage of 1 V, the terminal current is 1.80e-17 A. (The width is 2 micron.)
