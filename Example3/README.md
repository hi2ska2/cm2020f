A bipolar junction transistor

It has three terminals.
They are the emitter, the base, and the collector.
Usually, the emitter is used as a reference terminal.
We can apply positive voltages to the base and the collector.
Increase the collector voltage up to 1.5 V.
After that, increase the base voltage up to 1.0 V.

Assume the constant mobility. For electrons, it is 1417 cm^2/V sec. For holes, it is 470.4 cm^2/V sec.

When the device is two-micron wide, at V_BE = 1.0 V and V_CE = 1.5 V, terminal currents are:
I_C = 1.545e-10 A
I_B = 3.585e-12 A
