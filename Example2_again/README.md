A 4-micron-long pn diode

The doping profile is given as a separate file, diode.doping. 
Its doping density is written in (/cm3). 
For example, 1e19 means a n-type doping of 1e19 /cm3.

The terminal information is given as another separate file, diode.contact. First, we have the contact name. After that, the number of points is shown. In this example, you have 3. Then, the next 3 lines for the terminal nodes. Once a terminal is fully described, then, the name of the next contact appears.

Assume the constant mobility. For electrons, it is 1417 cm^2/V sec. For holes, it is 470.4 cm^2/V sec.

When the device is two-micron wide, the terminal current is 1.762e-3 A at the anode voltage of 1 V.

On the other hand, at the cathode voltage of 1 V, the terminal current is 1.46e-17 A.
