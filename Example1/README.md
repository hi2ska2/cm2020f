A 4-micron-long resistor

Assume the n-type doping of 1e16 /cm^3.

Assume two terminals are located at top and bottom.

Assume the constant mobility.
For electrons, it is 1417 cm^2/V sec.
For holes, it is 470.4 cm^2/V sec.

When the width is 1 micron, the terminal current is 5.767e-5 A at the terminal voltage of 1 V.
